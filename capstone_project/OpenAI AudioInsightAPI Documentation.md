1. Getting Started
Obtaining API Key

To use the OpenAI API, you need to obtain an API key from the OpenAI website. Sign up for access, and you'll receive an API key.
Installing Required Packages

Before getting started, make sure to install the required Python packages using the following command:

python

!pip install openai ipywidgets

2. OpenAI Client Initialization

Initialize the OpenAI client with your API key. Replace "your_api_key_here" with your actual API key.

python

import os
from openai import OpenAI

# Set your OpenAI API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key_here"

# Initialize OpenAI client
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

3. Audio Analysis
Transcription

The OpenAI API supports audio transcription using the Whisper ASR model.
Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis on transcribed text can be performed using the GPT-3.5-turbo model.
4. Usage Example
Analyzing Audio Files

Use the provided Jupyter Notebook cells to analyze audio files. The code includes functions for displaying audio controls, transcribing audio, and evaluating sentiment.
5. Conclusion

The OpenAI API provides powerful capabilities for audio analysis and natural language processing. This documentation serves as a guide for integrating the API into your Jupyter Notebook projects. For more details and advanced usage, refer to the official OpenAI API documentation.
